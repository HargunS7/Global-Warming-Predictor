Model Description:

1. ARIMA Model: ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting method that models the
relationship between the current observation and a fixed number of lagged observations.

3. RNN Model: RNN is a type of neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of
data and is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks due to its ability to retain information
over time through recurrent connections.
